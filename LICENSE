DISCLAIMER

This software interacts with smart contracts on the Radix distributed ledger.
By using this SDK, you acknowledge and accept that:

1. ON-LEDGER RISKS: Transactions submitted to the Radix Network are 
   irreversible. You are solely responsible for verifying transaction details
   before submission.

2. FINANCIAL RISKS: Domain registration requires bonding digital assets. The
   value of these assets may fluctuate. You may lose some or all of the value
   of assets used in transactions.

3. SMART CONTRACT RISKS: While the Namespace smart contracts have been designed with
   care, no software is free from bugs or vulnerabilities. The authors and
   contributors are not liable for any losses arising from smart contract
   interactions.

4. NO FINANCIAL ADVICE: This software and its documentation do not constitute
   financial, legal, or investment advice. Consult appropriate professionals
   before making financial decisions.

5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES: This SDK interacts with third-party services including
   the Radix Gateway API. The authors are not responsible for the availability,
   accuracy, or security of these services.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
