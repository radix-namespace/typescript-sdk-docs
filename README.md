1. **On-Ledger Risks** — Transactions submitted to the Radix Network are irreversible. You are solely responsible for verifying transaction details before submission.
2. **Financial Risks** — Domain registration requires bonding digital assets. The value of these assets may fluctuate. You may lose some or all of the value of assets used in transactions.
3. **Smart Contract Risks** — While the Namespace smart contracts have been designed with care, no software is free from bugs or vulnerabilities. The authors and contributors are not liable for any losses arising from smart contract interactions.
4. **No Financial Advice** — This software and its documentation do not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice. Consult appropriate professionals before making financial decisions.
5. **Third-Party Services** — This SDK interacts with third-party services including the Radix Gateway API. The authors are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or security of these services.
